Automates the generation of multidimensional list breadcrumb trails with Breadcrumb NavXT.

== Description ==

In the [Vista-Like Breadcrumbs for WordPress](http://mtekk.us/archives/guides/vista-like-breadcrumbs-for-wordpress/) guide, code was presented for recreating the breadcrumb style featured in Windows Vista and Windows 7. That code eventually was updated and placed into a plugin to ease implementation. This is that plugin.

= Breadcrumb NavXT Versions Supported =

This plugin supports Breadcrumb NavXT 5.0.x and Breadcrumb NavXT 5.1.x.

== Installation ==
Open the appropriate file for your theme (typically header.php). This can be done within WordPress’ administration panel through Presentation > Theme Editor or through your favorite text editor. Place one of the following code snippets where you want the breadcrumb trail to appear.

= Siblings in the Second Dimension =
The following code will produce a multidimensional breadcrumb trail with the siblings of a breadcrumb in it’s second dimension:
`<ul class="breadcrumbs">
	<?php if(function_exists('bcn_display_list_multidim'))
	{
		bcn_display_list_multidim();
	}?>
</ul>`
= Children in the Second Dimension =
The following code will produce a multidimensional breadcrumb trail with the children of a breadcrumb in it’s second dimension:
`<ul class="breadcrumbs">
	<?php if(function_exists('bcn_display_list_multidim_children'))
	{
		bcn_display_list_multidim_children();
	}?>
</ul>`
Save the file (upload if applicable). Now you should have a breadcrumb trail on your WordPress powered site. To customize the breadcrumb trail you may edit the default values for the options in the administrative interface. This is located in your administration panel under Settings > Breadcrumb NavXT.
